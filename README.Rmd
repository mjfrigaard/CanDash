## Welcome to the `CanDash`!

This is a [`flexdashboard`](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/) for simulated sales cannabis data. 

```{r candash-overview, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/candash-overview.png")
```

## The data

The data model for the `CanDash` application had to be constructed from a few different sources. First, a list of products, brands, and other categorical data were imported form the Kushy application on Github. You can find the original data for this project [here](https://github.com/kushyapp/cannabis-dataset). 

We had to simulate the cost data for the products in the `Products` and `Brands` tables. Read more about this process in the [`01.1-wrangle.md` file](https://github.com/mjfrigaard/CanDash/blob/master/01.1-wrangle.md). 

## The visualizations

All the visualizations were built in the [`02-visualize.md`](https://github.com/mjfrigaard/CanDash/blob/master/02-visualize.md) file using [`ggplot2`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/), [`plotly`](https://github.com/ropensci/plotly#readme), and [`highcharter`](http://jkunst.com/highcharter/).
